Dear recruiter at MongoDB,

Hope you are safe and well!

MongoDB is a great product, I learned and used it during my post-graduate education, fantastic!

I learned the Cloud Operations Engineer role from Linkedin, the tech stack looks exciting to me, and I am very interested in this role.

I am a Master of Applied Computing student in University of Windsor, open to fulltime job - from Sep 2021, with 4-month Co-op followed by at least 3-year PGWP.

Meanwhile, I am a Christian and vegetarian & meditator, mentally and physically healthy, energetic and quick-learner.
Good at Python (3+ years), AWS (2 years & certified), C/C++(10 years).

Thank you for reviewing my application.

Wen Dong
Best regards
