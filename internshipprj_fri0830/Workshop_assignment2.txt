Workshop on Deep Learning (Part 2)
Participatory Assessment
Q. 1. Write 5 applications of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
1). vision system in self driving car
2). facial detection/object detection in Facebook tagging
3). Robot vision of Boston Dynamics' Robot
4). Camera Beatifying effect 
5). Artificial sound of assistants like Apple Siri, Micro Soft Cortana

Q. 2. What are the things to consider becoming an expert in Deep Learning (write 3 points)?
1). Learn basic Macine Learning techniques, supervised learning & unsupervised learning, classification, clustering, regression etc.
2). pick a project to get hands-on the popular tools and frameworks & libraries.
3). gain understanding of basic pertinent Mathematic knowledge, like probability and statistics, linear algrbra. Calculus.

Q. 3. Write the name of three strategies to reduce the overfitting.
1). Regularizations techniques - L1 & L2 regularization
2). Dropout
3). Data Augmentation
4). Early stopping

Q. 4. Why transfer learning is useful?
Transfer learning is to create a new model by applying new dataset to a related pretrained model, it's useful when new amount of dataset is limited.

Q. 5. Why do we need data augmentation?
data augmentation can significantly increase the diversity of training data without collecting new data
